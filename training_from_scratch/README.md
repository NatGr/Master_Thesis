# training_from_scratch

This repo contains code to train neural networks in tensorflow 1.13.1 and then save them in .tflite models to perform inference on a rasberry-pi.  

Due to the poor image augmentation capabilities of tensorflow.keras, the [albumentations library](https://github.com/albu/albumentations) was used as well.
