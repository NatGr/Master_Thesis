# Master Thesis repository: Machine learning under resource constraints
## Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Geurts and Jean-Michel Begon, ULi√®ge 2019

### Objectives:
The objective of this master thesis is to explore the different techniques used to reduce the resource consumptions of CNNs at inference. 
Due to GPU-ressource limitations, we limited ourselves to use the CIFAR-10 dataset in order to compare the different networks.
The techniques investigated were:
    1. Base CNN architecture (WideResnet, DenseNet, EffNet, CondenseNet, MobileNet,...) and their related parameters (depth, width, bottlenecks,...)
    2. Number of channels per layers (fisher pruning and morphnet)
